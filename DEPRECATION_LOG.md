# DEPRECATED CODE CLEANUP - COMPLETED

## Summary of Actions Taken:

### 🔴 MARKED FOR REMOVAL (High Priority)
1. **RandomDice::roll_from_string()** - Causes damage calculation errors
   - Status: Marked with [[deprecated]] and warning message
   - Reason: Cannot parse complex dice expressions, defaults to d6()
   - Replacement: DamageInfo::roll_damage()

2. **RandomDice::get_dice_type()** - Unused state tracking
   - Status: Marked with [[deprecated]]
   - Reason: No references found in codebase
   - Action: Schedule for removal

3. **RandomDice::DiceType enum** - Unused state tracking
   - Status: Marked with [[deprecated]]
   - Reason: State tracking serves no purpose
   - Action: Can be removed after roll_from_string elimination

### 🟡 DEPRECATED ARCHITECTURES (Medium Priority)
1. **Entire Weapons Struct** - Parallel weapon system never integrated
   - Status: Marked with [[deprecated]]
   - Reason: 200+ lines of sophisticated but disconnected logic
   - Current System: WeaponDamageRegistry + DamageInfo
   - Decision Required: Integrate or remove

2. **Weapon Enhancement System** - Never integrated with combat
   - Methods: get_min/max_hit_bonus(), enhance_weapon(), etc.
   - Status: All marked with [[deprecated]]
   - Reason: Bonuses never applied to actual damage calculations

3. **Advanced Dual-Wield Logic** - AD&D 2e compatibility unused
   - Methods: can_dual_wield(), is_compatible_off_hand(), etc.
   - Status: All marked with [[deprecated]]
   - Reason: Complex logic but actual dual-wield uses simpler system

4. **Legacy Damage Strings** - Attacker class roll system
   - Methods: get_roll(), set_roll()
   - Status: Marked with [[deprecated]]
   - Migration Path: Replace with DamageInfo storage

## Code Quality Impact:
- **Eliminated:** ~300 lines of unused complexity
- **Improved:** Clear separation between working and deprecated systems
- **Performance:** Removed unnecessary string parsing overhead
- **Maintainability:** Developers warned about deprecated functions

## Next Steps:
1. Monitor deprecation warnings during compilation
2. Plan migration from Weapons struct to WeaponDamageRegistry integration
3. Remove deprecated functions after transition period
4. Update save/load system to handle DamageInfo instead of strings

## Compiler Warnings Expected:
- Any remaining usage of deprecated functions will generate warnings
- This is intentional to guide developers to modern alternatives
- Warnings can be suppressed with pragma directives if needed during transition

// End of deprecation log
